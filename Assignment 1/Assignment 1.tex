The problem with all these quiz pages is that they give you a timer you have to finish within or you automatically lose. This is much less ideal for someone whom simply wants to know how fast they can do it. For this reason, I have created a simple program testing the concept of creating this in LabVIEW. I have limited the program to only the first 9 Pokémon and a simple timer counting up.

In the front panel the program needs a timer which is updated inside the loop and counts the seconds, minutes and hours having elapsed since start. I have chosen three numerical indicators to show the seconds, minutes and hours separately. Then the program needs a display where the correct names will appear when they are guessed and an input window where the player can give their guesses. These
